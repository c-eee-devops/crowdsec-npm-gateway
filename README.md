# Nginx Proxy Manager Configuration With Croudsec

## Requiurements

- A little bit of Docker experience

- For this guide, I will be utilizing a portainer instance that has already been configured using Docker.

- A domain that already points to your old Nginx proxy manager instance (which I assume you configured with a database)
